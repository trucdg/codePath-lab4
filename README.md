## Project 4: Screen Capture!
### Overview:
This App uses the ApiFlash API to take screenshots of a given website with a variety of parameters. In this lab, I will try to make a simple static API call from the website. Then, I will build out an interface that allows me to get my own screenshots and insert them into the page

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals 
By the end of this lab you will be able to...
- [ ] Make a static API call using async/await and save the results to a state variable
- [ ] Be able to add and edit query parameters for API calls

## âœŒ Features
**Required Features**
- [ ] Allow the user to add at least three parameters to a query to the ApiFlash API
- [ ] Display the screenshot returned by the ApiFlash call on the page
- [ ] On a separate part of the page, display all the images the user has queried thus far
